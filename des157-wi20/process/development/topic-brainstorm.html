      <p>For my brainstorming process, I used an associative brainstorming technique called mind mapping to visually organize data and information. I'm the type of person to always branch off ideas that I have, so this mind map was helpful for me because it works like branches forming off a tree. I like my idea of making an interactive website that would generate healthy meals for the user. This process lead me to a specific idea about creating a website that shares vegan recipes. I'm still not exactly sure what interactive elements I'll have, but I do want to focus on healthy eating as my topic. I really like the idea regarding veganism and spreading awareness about the meat industry. I want to inform people about how the meat and dairy industry negatively impact people and the environment. My website would propose solutions on transitioning to a more plant-based diet. This would be a promising idea to pursue because I am very passionate about veganism and overall healthy eating. I would like to make an interactive website that informs people on issues surrounding that topic and showing different recipes. This mind mapping process helped me write out whatever popped in my head.</p>
