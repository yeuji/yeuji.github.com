      <p>I decided to go with a yellow green color scheme to represent my topic about sustainable living. In the beginning screen, the user can interact by clicking on the "BEGIN" button to start learning about environmental issues such as plastic pollution. I want to keep a minimal, clean, and simple interface so that key information stands out. I want to make my type hierachy strong by bolding and and enlarging important facts. I will incorporate flat vector icons to make the pages more unique. I chose to add button options for the donation page and I used gradients to add a pop of vibrant colors. I chose simple 4 circles for the navigation on the right side of homepage so that the user can conveniently go to whatever section they want to read about. Update: for version 2, I changed some of the colors for the headings and added a white box section for the donation form. I also replaced filler text with actual content about my subject.</p>
