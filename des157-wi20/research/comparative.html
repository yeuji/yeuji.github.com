    <h2>Ocean School</h2>

    <p>Ocean School is an interactive adventure website that allows visitors to explore and learn all about the oceans by scrolling with the mouse. It is packed full of different ocean-related designs, including the 3D images of marine animals, the fluid effects and animations, and the blue & white color schemes, etc. It has a linear navigation design on the right side of the screen, which makes it much easy to get around. The vertical navigation bar on the right provides a functionality clue for the user to scroll down. The user can click on a specific point on the navigation to automatically go down to that section. The content on the homepages is simple, but effective because it shows the main points. This technique is very useful for a general audience because people usually don't like to read a lot of dense text. This website has a nice type hierarchy for each section as you scroll down the page because the headers are big and bold and the captions are clear and concise. I like how the content on this website shows a story by scrolling down. For my project, I think this interaction can be a special way of telling a story about animal cruelty/health problems and offering solutions (veganism/plant-based diet) as the user scrolls down. It would be a powerful way of storytelling and it can emotionally affect my audience to make healthier changes for their bodies and the environment. Ocean School caught my attention immediately because of the beautiful imagery that was used. There is a quote on the page that emotionally engages the user, so I was thinking I could also include a quote about the whole meat industry/vegan story. I think something that could be better with this website is including forms because it would be easier to fill out information on the home page.

    <h2>Earthling Ed</h2>

    <p>Earthling Ed is a prominent vegan activist, animal rights advocate and co-founder of SURGE. He's involved in all sorts of activism, from organizing marches to touring the country in a van and speaking at universities. His website is a great place to learn about different types of activism because he's always up to something new and interesting. In the middle of the page, there is a form where the user can sign up to receive newsletters. I like how it didn't pop up when I first opened the site because I don't think pop-ups are effective at getting users to provide their information. The form is well-designed because it is big with enough breathable space for the elements. The title of the form also says "Become a Supporter of Earthling Ed." I think the phrase could be improved to be more engaging for the user. It's a little bland, but for my form for my interactive project, I would want to include some sort of cute animation feature in the form. I think little interactive features could make my website stand out more. But for this form, I do like how everything is laid out horizontally because it flows better when I'm filling in my information. The content on this page includes many phrases and quotes about vegan activism, which is helpful because the purpose of the website is to form people about these issues. Because the website has a minimal black and white aesthetic, the emotional impact is a bit low for me. I think I would add a bit more color to make it more engaging. I do approve of the use of a lot of imagery and photos. However, I would probably include statistical data and graphs on my homepage about how the meat industry affects the environment. I think something that could improve the interaction on this site would be to enable horizontal scrolling of images.
