    <h1>Annie Deng's Final Project Academic Research</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I researched about how the meat industry can negatively affect the environment and human health. According to a newspaper article, Bacterial infections can be transmitted to humans and they can also spread through farms (Zee, 2019). During this modern era, these harmful pathogens can easily enter farming environments and cause illnesses. As for environmental impact, meat production takes up way more resources compared to vegetables and fruits. It was estimated that veggies had a water footprint of approximately 322 litres per kilogram. Fruits took up 962 litres per kilogram. Chicken was 4,325l/kg. Pork was 5,988l/kg. Beef came in at a whopping 15,415l/kg. The general population knows that meat is bad, but they are probably not that concerned about it because most people don't directly see what is happening in the farms and they don't see the direct impact on the environment. The Earth is facing some serious issues as the freshwater reservoirs are drying up. We only have so many natural resources and water is not an unlimited resource. Some studies calculated that farming takes up about 90% of the planet's freshwater. Water pollution is another major concern that results from farms. Eutrophication is the condition in which there are excessive nutrients and organic matter in large bodies of water, which causes a stunt for growth of plant life due to the lack of oxygen in the waters. Majority of our land resources are used for livestock. 80% of all agricultural land is dedicated to the production of feeding animals. This causes deforestation problems. I was thinking of how I can incorporate these statistical data into my interactive scrolling feature to tell a story. I also have an idea of creating boxes that the user can click on and then

      I recently watched a speech by Gary Yourofsky, an animal rights activist. According to the one-hour speech, veganism would be an appropriate step to take right now (Pangambam, 2020). If all Americans made an effort to reduce their consumption of meat, we would meet our goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Gary's powerful speech that promoted a vegan lifestyle was informative and it was also emotionally impactful. Basically, he talked about how humans have absolutely no biological need for meat. Humans are born vegans. The human body is physiologically 100% herbivorous. He made a point about how if you put a rabbit and a carrot in front of a baby, the baby would obviously choose the carrot to put in their mouth. Every nutrient we need can be grown on Earth. Humans are being brainwashed to consume more meat. One powerful quote was, "But do you know what’s more insane than that? Meat eaters. Walking around like their lifestyle isn’t causing any harm, like it’s normal and natural to be consuming violence and death. How would you feel, if the day that you were born, somebody else had already planned the day of your execution? That’s what it’s like to be a cow, a pig, a chicken or a turkey on this planet." He said that a meat-eater normally consumes about 3,000 land animals for their whole life. I was thinking how I could input some quotes to have an emotional impact on the my user as they're scrolling through my website.

      Finally, I researched about how someone can take action to live and eat more sustainably. Important ingredients that should be on a vegan's shopping list are mushrooms, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, black garlic, and brassicas (Pullman, 2019). Mushrooms are texturally nice to eat and they can be a a meat substitute made of hydrated gluten. Sweet potatoes can be put in soups, stews, curries, or they can be baked. Brassicas can be boiled along with any other green vegetables. When buying processsed foods, it is important to remember that the fewer and more recognizable ingredients there are, the better it is. The more I'm researching about these topics, I feel like I want to maybe incorporate elements on my interactive project that educate the user on how to not just eat more sustainably, but also how to live a sustainable life in general.
