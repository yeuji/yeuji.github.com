    <h1>Fruity Game</h1>
    <p>There are three players: Annie, Jennie, and Lisa. The player whose turn it is rolls the dice. The total of the roll is added to the current player's score. If a dice rolls out to be a 1, then the player's turn is over, and it is the other playerâ€™s turn. After each roll, the current player can either roll again, or if the current player feels that luck is running thin, they can pass to the other player. The first player to get 20 points or higher wins.</p>
    <p>If your roll totals to 2 or 4, then you get 5 extra points!</p>
